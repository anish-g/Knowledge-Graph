‘Security situation worsening’,RAUTAHAT NOVEMBER 11 Nepal Communist Party (NCP) Province 2 Chairperson Prabhu Sah who was elected as member of Parliament from Rautahat Constituency-3 has observed that the security situation in the district has worsened due to the police force’s love for commission. Speaking to journalists in Gaur today the ruling party leader lamented the tendency of the police administration to unnecessarily hassle individuals buying goods from India for their personal use. “Big smugglers are doing their illegal business using their connections but when it comes to ordinary people the police are arresting them for commission even if they bring things that are not found in the local markets for personal use” observed Sah. “Since the entire police force is busy controlling smuggling from across the border it has led to the increase in crime in the Tarai districts” the leader reasoned. “We have a system that allows police to receive commission for giving a tip-off about a smuggling bid or something. This is not good; we can propose such incentive for ordinary people instead not for police personnel” he added. Sah particularly cited incidents of police seizing chemical fertiliser brought by farmers from India. Chemical fertiliser is in short supply in Nepal now. “The police’s success isn’t reflected by their ability to arrest these poor people bringing things that are in short supply in Nepal from India” he argued.   A version of this article appears in print on November 12 2020 of The Himalayan Times.

People from high hills migrating to lowlands as mercury dips,BAJURA NOVEMBER 11 With the mercury plummeting further the indigenous communities of the upper belt of Bajura and other nearby districts have started migrating to lower elevations in western Nepal. Just like the previous years this year too the residents of northern Bajura Humla and Mugu have started descending to lower elevations with their herd of sheep and Himalayan goats and cows. Most of these families migrate to places such as Barhabisa and Kuldevmandau of Bajura Achham Doti and Surkhet. Migrating to lower elevations helps them shun the extreme cold. Most of these families engage in trade to make some money during this time. Lok Gurung of Pandusen Himali Rural Municipality is heading to Achham with his seven-member family. He will stay there for around six months. “People say we must stay at our own place to be keep coronavirus away but we have no option. We can’t stay put in our own place and suffer the extreme cold” said Gurung. “More than the fear of the virus we fear the extreme cold that can kill us and again this is the time when we can make some money by doing some business” he said. The Bhote and other communities that live in the upper belt of Bajura go to the bordering Chinese territories to the north during the four months of the rainy season. “We’ve been migrating to lower altitudes for years during this time. It not only helps us avoid the cold but also helps us make some money and look after our family” said Jagat Lama ward 3 member of Gumba Himali Rural Municipality. According to locals the trend of mass migration is depriving kids of education. In Bajura alone more than 640 families of the upper belt migrate to lower altitudes during winter. As everyone in the villages migrate with their families and cattle the kids miss their schools. Again women and their kids are also deprived of basic vaccines during this period.

Harris’ husband Doug Emhoff poised to break stereotypes,SACRAMENTO: In the Biden White House the first lady wants to keep her job teaching and the second gentleman plans to quit his law firm to support the vice president’s career. When it comes to political marriages we’ve reached a new moment.   Doug Emhoff the 56-year-old husband of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will leave his private law practice by Inauguration Day to focus on his role at the White House a spokesperson said Tuesday. He’s said little so far about how he’ll approach the role and is still working with the transition team on what issues he’ll tackle. “We’ve been waiting for this sort of gender switch for decades now” said Kim Nalder a professor of political science who has focused on women and gender at California State University-Sacramento. She added “There is a lot of symbolism from a man stepping back from his high-powered career in order to support his wife’s career.” Spouses often build public awareness or advocacy campaigns around key issues. Current second lady Karen Pence promotes art therapy and focuses on military families. Jill Biden also spotlighted military families and promoted community colleges as the vice president’s wife. Emhoff’s decision to cut ties with DLA Piper also offered an early test of how a Biden administration would avoid potential ethical issues. While Emhoff is not a lobbyist the firm has a large presence lobbying the federal government on behalf of clients including Comcast Raytheon and the government of Puerto Rico. He took a leave of absence from the firm in August when Biden chose Harris a U.S. senator from California as his running mate. While Emhoff built a career as a high-profile entertainment lawyer in Southern California he’s been most visible to voters as Harris’ supportive husband. He quickly befriended other political spouses in the Democratic primary when Harris sought the party’s nomination. “I want more women in office and I want more partners whoever their partner is to support them and to provide an opportunity and an environment for success” Emhoff said in an October interview with the digital site NowThis News. He was not made available for an interview with The Associated Press. Chasten Buttigieg the husband of former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said the two quickly formed a friendship as they swapped stories about people they were meeting and their strange “fish out of water” experiences as political spouses. Emhoff would compliment Chasten Buttigieg on his speeches at events and never approached him as a competitor. “He was just there for the right reasons” Chasten Buttigieg said. “It was because he loved his wife and he thought that she would make a great president.” Buttigieg who also would have broken barriers as a male presidential spouse said he remembered how often he was asked what title he would use a question that seemed frivolous. (Emhoff hasn’t officially selected his title. But Biden has referred to him as the “second gentleman.”) Buttigieg expects Emhoff to thrive in his new job as a public servant. “You just have to be someone that people can see themselves in” he said. “People love chatting with him and getting pictures with him. He’s always full of dad jokes and he’s really disarming.” Emhoff embraced his role as a political surrogate during the campaign. He will be the first Jewish spouse of a president or a vice president and he was a prominent liaison to Jewish groups and donors. He also developed a close friendship with Jill Biden a former second lady and the two campaigned together frequently in states including Iowa and New Hampshire. Jill Biden has said she wants to keep teaching at a community college as she did when Joe Biden was the vice president. Harris on Monday tweeted a photo of herself and Emhoff smiling on the night Biden was announced the winner of the election. “Meet the love of my life” she told her 11 million followers. It was Emhoff who filmed a video of Harris calling Biden after news of their win which she shared on social media. Harris and Emhoff met in 2013 and married a year later. It was Harris’ first marriage and Emhoff’s second; his children are in their 20s and call Harris “Momala” a play on her name and a Yiddish word for “little mother.” The two were set up by a friend and Harris recalls the scrutiny she faced as a single woman in her 40s and her hesitance to be public about her relationships in her memoir “The Truths We Hold.” She first brought Emhoff out in public to a 2014 speech about a truancy initiative she’d pursued. Her team would refer to everything that came next as A.D. — After Doug. “They knew how much he made me laugh. I did too” she writes. Harris was attorney general of California at the time and Emhoff was practicing law as a managing director for the West Coast branch of Venable LLP handling clients in the entertainment industry with a focus on trademark disputes and intellectual property. He’d previously represented clients including Merck Walmart and an arms-dealer based in Fresno California clients that today seem out of step with progressive wings of the Democratic Party. When Harris began her term in the U.S. Senate in 2017 Emhoff moved to DLA Piper which had a presence in Washington and Los Angeles where Harris and Emhoff split their time. More recently he’s represented clients including a production company and a prominent wine maker. John Bessler the husband of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar who is also a lawyer called Emhoff a “modern man” for dedicating time to Harris’ political career over his own. “This is just another example of how supportive he’s being of Kamala” he said.  
Texas tops 1 million cases as COVID-19 surge engulfs the US,Texas on Wednesday became the first state with more than 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and California closed in on that mark as a surge of coronavirus infections engulfs the country. In New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said all restaurants bars and gyms statewide will have to close at 10 p.m. starting Friday a major retreat in a corner of the U.S. that had seemingly brought the virus largely under control months ago. He also barred private gatherings of more than 10 people.   Texas the second-most populous state has recorded 1.02 million coronavirus cases and over 19000 deaths since the outbreak began in early March according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. California the most populous state has logged more than 995000 cases. The U.S. has recorded over 240000 deaths and more than 10.3 million confirmed infections with new cases soaring to all-time highs of well over 120000 per day over the past week. Health experts have blamed the increase in part on the onset of cold weather and growing frustration with mask-wearing and other precautions. Cases per day are on the rise in 49 states and deaths per day are climbing in 39. A month ago the U.S. was seeing about 730 COVID-19 deaths per day on average; that has now surpassed 970. Among the many health officials sounding the alarm was Dr. Julie Watson of Integris Health in Oklahoma. “We are in trouble” she said. “If nothing is done soon to slow the rise in cases our hospitals will be more overwhelmed than they already are and we won’t be able to be there for all of those who need it.” Oklahoma’s health department said Wednesday that 1248 people were hospitalized for confirmed or probable coronavirus shattering the previous one-day record of 1055. Texas reported 10865 new cases on Tuesday breaking a record set in mid-July. One of the hardest-hit places is the border city of El Paso; its county has nearly 28000 active cases and has suffered more than 680 COVID-19 deaths. The American Medical Association renewed its plea for mask-wearing physical distancing and frequent hand-washing. “With the holidays quickly approaching each of us must do everything possible to reduce the spread of COVID-19” AMA President Susan Bailey said. “Failing to do our part will prolong the suffering and disruption to our lives and inevitably lead to more deaths of our friends neighbors and loved ones.” Meanwhile many traditional Veterans Day celebrations gave way to somber virtual gatherings Wednesday. Many veterans homes have barred visitors to protect their residents from the virus. In New York City a quiet parade of military vehicles with no spectators rolled through Manhattan to maintain the 101-year tradition of veterans marching on Fifth Avenue. More than 4200 veterans have died from COVID-19 at hospitals and homes run by the Department of Veterans Affairs and nearly 85000 have been infected according to the department. Around the country: — The NFL’s Minnesota Vikings said it will close its remaining home games to fans as the state blew past its record for new deaths in a day. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced new restrictions on bars and restaurants and said he wishes the neighboring Dakotas would take more aggressive steps to slow the spread of the coronavirus. He said this summer’s Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota was “absolutely unnecessary” and helped spread the virus beyond that state. — Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine issued new orders on mask enforcement at businesses while threatening to close bars restaurants and fitness centers if infections keep surging. The Republican governor shifted the authority over mask enforcement from the counties to the state. If a business receives more than one violation it must close for 24 hours. He’s also requiring businesses to display ‘No Mask No Service’ signs and refuse service to customers who don’t comply. But DeWine’s orders Wednesday were not as far-reaching as in March when Ohio became one of the first states to go into lockdown. — In Nebraska which is setting records for COVID-19 hospitalizations new restrictions took effect Wednesday. Those include a requirement to wear masks at businesses where employees have close contact with customers for more than 15 minutes such as barbershops and a limit on large indoor gatherings to 25% of a building’s capacity. Gov. Pete Ricketts and his wife have gone into quarantine after being exposed to someone with the virus. — North Carolina reported its highest single-day increase in coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic with 3119 people — 8% of those tested — testing positive for the virus. — Kentucky posted a record daily high for new confirmed cases at 2700 as the governor implored people to wear masks to counter the accelerating outbreak. — A group of Utah teachers is encouraging colleagues statewide to call in sick Thursday and use the day to get tested for the virus. Some teachers believe the action could prompt state officials to do more to increase classroom safety. — In Sioux Falls the largest city in hard-hit South Dakota Mayor Paul TenHaken cast a tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate. Violations would have carried a $50 fine. — North Dakota continues to have the most new COVID-19 cases per capita in the nation according to Johns Hopkins data with one in every 83 residents testing positive in the past week.

SC’s constitutional bench to conduct hearing on NCP leader Gautam’s case today,KATHMANDU: The constitutional bench of Supreme Court will conduct the hearing on two writ petitions filed against nomination of vice-chair of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) Bamdev Gautam to the National Assembly today. Media expert at the apex court Kishor Paudel told THT Online that the SC constitutional bench will be conducting the hearing on the case from today. Paudel informed that the constitutional bench includes judges Deepak Kumar Karki Hari Krishna Karki Bishwambhar Prasad Shrestha and Ishwor Khatiwada led by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher JB Rana. Gautam who had lost the House of Representatives election in the last general election from his home constituency of Bardiya-1 was nominated by the President to the Upper House of the parliament on the recommendation of the government on September 17. Senior advocates Dinesh Tripathi and Badriraj Bhatta have argued that as per constitutional provision a person who was defeated in the House of Representatives election could not become a minister during the current tenure of the HoR and hence Gautam’s nomination to the Upper House of the Parliament was against the spirit of the constitution. A single bench of the SC had earlier ordered the government not to assign extra constitutional responsibility to Gautam and to maintain status quo on the issue till the court decides whether or not there is a need for issuing an interim order in the case. Joint Attorney Sanjeeb Raj Regmi defended the government’s decision to nominate Gautam to the Upper House arguing that the National Assembly Election Act had not disqualified Gautam from being nominated to the Upper House. Former attorney general Yubaraj Sangraula senior advocate Raghav Lal Baidya and former president of Nepal Bar Association Sher Bahadur KC pleaded on behalf of Gautam.

13596 households to get safe houses,KATHMANDU NOVEMBER 11 The Government of Nepal has selected as many as 13596 beneficiaries under safe citizen housing programme said a source at the Ministry of Urban Development. Of those selected beneficiaries grant agreements were reached with 11879 households till mid-October. According to a quarterly proactive disclosure made by the MoUD last week construction of houses belonging to 3269 beneficiaries who concluded the mandatory grant agreements have been completed. “The Ministry of Finance has already allocated the budget to local levels for the implementation of the safe citizen housing programme on recommendation of the MoUD” read the report. According to the MoUD the programme is executed in line with Safe Citizen Housing Implementation Procedure-2019 to ensure arrangement of appropriate safe and environment-friendly housing for people living below the poverty line and those who have been rendered homeless due to various types of natural disasters. This requires the government to identify and select beneficiaries on the basis of the recommendation letter of the concerned local level and district disaster management committee. Only the families living in a hut or house with thatched roof which is vulnerable to fire rain and storm will benefit from this scheme. “Priority shall be attached to families with senior citizens orphans single women and persons with disabilities. Any joint family is entitled to grant amount for only one housing unit” reads the procedure. The procedure has empowered the Safe Citizen Housing Coordination Committee led by a directly elected member of the House of Representatives to select beneficiaries from among the families identified by the Federal Level Project Implementation Unit in the concerned constituency. The FLPIU will enter into a grant agreement with the selected beneficiaries for the purpose of construction of safe housing. The grant amount is provided through a banking channel in two instalments 60 per cent and 40 per cent. After receiving the first tranche of the grant amount the concerned beneficiary shall proceed with housing construction work. The last instalment shall be released once a report from the concerned local level and technical committee confirm that the first instalment was properly used. Amount exceeding the grant for construction shall be borne by the concerned family. If the grant amount is not found to have been used for the purpose for which it was provided the FLPIU shall recover the cash from the concerned beneficiary as a government due. Beneficiaries of the post-earthquake reconstruction and vulnerable settlement relocation among other schemes shall not be entitled to the grant referred to in the procedure.

The government’s decision was criticised as many saw the decision as aiming to derail the country from the federal democratic republican system as enshrined in the 2015 constitution. The committee had thus summoned Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to discuss the government’s decision. However Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali who was present at the meeting on behalf of the PM defended the decision saying the move was to bring ‘unity’ on the country’s name and to ease communication. Answering the committee Gyawali said “ Our country’s official name is Nepal. There is no need to add any other adjective.” He also said the government did not have any bad intention while taking the decision. The committee’s official informed that Gyawali had stressed that the government had never adopted ‘Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal’ as the official name. “The constitution also does not mention the country’s name to be so” Gyawali said. After the discussion the committee’s Chair Sashi Shrestha said “The Cabinet decision of September 27 itself proves that the country’s official name is Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. Thus it has asked the government not to implement the decision immediately.” She also told the government that if it wanted to change the name then this should be tabled at the federal Parliament. Constitution expert Pankaj Kumar Karna said that although it was true that country’s official name did not have the words ‘Federal Democratic Republic’ the way in which the government took the decision was incorrect. He further said the decision also drew flak because many lawmakers of the ruling party had often been heard speaking unfavourably about federalism in the country. Karna said “This provoked suspicion that the government was in the process of losing all the achievements attained after a long struggle.” He added “Had the government tabled the issue in the Parliament and heard the view of all the representatives it would have been much better.” This decision was only about the name not about the form of governance he said adding that efforts to connect it to forms of governance were inappropriate. “The political system (of the federal democratic republic) can be changed only with an amendment to the constitution backed by twothirds majority lawmakers” he said. Ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) lawmakers Bijay Subba and Nawaraj Silwal forwarded a note of dissent asking the committee not to doubt that the government would backtrack on federalism.

‘Rights situation deplorable during pandemic’,KATHMANDU NOVEMBER 8 The National Human Rights Commission has expressed concern about poor human rights situation in Bagmati Province during the COVID-19 crisis. A report released by the NHRC Bagmati Province Office last week said the government had failed to initiate preparedness measures against the pandemic. “The government did not make enough effort to control or avoid the outbreak of the disease and lagged behind in cashing in on the delayed onset of the contagion in the country thereby worsening the rights situation” read the report. Nepal reported the first case of the virus in March when many countries in the world had already been passing through the crisis. Limited number of quarantine and isolation facilities lack of health workers and life-saving medical equipment like ventilators poor arrangement of labs and hospitals low coverage of PCR test and delay in operation of coronavirus dedicated hospitals contributed to spike in COVID-19 cases it read. According to the report the government also failed to properly utilise the nationwide lockdown period to prevent and control COVID-19. The NHRC said increasing cases of COVID-19 despite the lockdown was worrisome as the government did not take initiatives to expand the PCR test coverage in a timely manner. Initially the government preferred RDT to PCR method. RDT is not as reliable as PCR. Only PCR testing technology can confirm whether a person is infected with the virus. As per the report hospitals and health workers did not have access to personal protective equipment. Cases of gender-based violence increased during the lockdown period and all three tiers of government did not adopt effective measures to prevent and control such incidents. Differently-abled persons senior citizens pregnant and lactating women and infants children and other vulnerable groups were most affected by the pandemic and their rights situated deteriorated. The government was not up to the mark to strictly implement ‘Standard on Operation and Management of Quarantine for COVID-19’ for providing basic amenities to quarantined persons. Many institutional quarantine centres lacked basic amenities and skilled human resources and necessary medical equipment such as oxygen cylinders and ventilators. The report has also expressed serious concern about deteriorating humanitarian situation of thousands of daily wagers in Kathmandu valley patients requiring medical check-up and follow-up and people taking a long walk home amid the nationwide lockdown imposed by the government. The NHRC had formed a monitoring committee in each province to monitor various issues including government’s performance in the fight against COVID-19 arrangement of medical treatment consumer rights freedom of expression access to justice and civic duties during the ongoing crisis. “The government failed to stop production and supply of substandard goods food adulteration overcharging and black-marketing” read the report.

Oli seeks Nepal’s help to resolve crisis in ruling party,The party’s problems are rooted in leaders who have already led the party and the government KATHMANDU NOVEMBER 8 A day after five members of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) Secretariat upped the ante against Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli by making a formal demand for calling party Secretariat meeting the PM called senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal at his residence in Baluwatar to discuss political crisis in the party. Co-chair of the NCP Pushpa Kamal Dahal had recently told party leaders that the PM who has fallen into minority in the NCP Secretariat Standing Committee and Central Committee was not ready to call party bodies’ meetings and would rather split the party ‘on friendly terms’. Surendra Prasad Pandey who accompanied Nepal in the meeting with the PM today told THT that the PM sought Nepal’s support to resolve the crisis in the party but Nepal told Oli that he should come up with a concrete plan. Nepal also asked the PM to call the Secretariat meeting soon. A source close to Oli told THT that in the three-hour meeting with Nepal the PM said he had publicly announced that he would not seek to become the PM or NCP chair again after the current tenure and all party leaders who were around 70 years of age and had already become the party chief or the prime minister should also pledge to do the same to pave the way for young leaders of the party to take party leadership. The party’s problems are rooted in leaders who have already led the party and the government the PM told Nepal. The rival faction of the ruling party led by Dahal has accused the PM of acting unilaterally reshuffling the federal Cabinet without consulting other leaders of the party defying party decisions and engineering a no-trust motion against Karnali Chief Minister Mahendra Bahadur Shahi. NCP leader Bhim Bahadur Rawal and Raghuji Panta also accompanied Nepal when he went to meet the PM. Rawal said both sides exchanged their views on the current crisis but did not reach any conclusion. Asked if the PM’s meeting with Nepal was an attempt to rally the support of leaders who were formerly associated with the CPN-UML Rawal said no. Yesterday Deputy Prime Minister Ishwar Pokharel who is close to Oli had held a meeting with NCP Kathmandu chapter leaders who were formerly associated with the CPN-UML. Recently Oli had chaired a virtual meeting with the party’s Province 1 chapter leaders and told them to start a debate in favour of people’s multi-party democracy championed by the erstwhile UML. NCP lawmaker Beduram Bhusal who is close to Nepal said Oli had been trying to portray the current crisis as merely a power tussle between him and Dahal. “Current issues concern everybody in the party. Nepal has been saying that the party should be run on the basis of party norms and statute. No leader of the party is above party norms and rules and Nepal continues to stick to what he has been saying all these months” he said. Nepal conveyed the same message to the PM today. Nepal was among the five Secretariat members — others being Dahal Jhalanath Khanal Bamdev Gautam and Narayan Kaji Shrestha — who wrote a letter to Oli yesterday seeking his consent to call a Secretariat meeting to discuss the COVID-19 crisis and implementation of the party’s Standing Committee decisions.

Water scarcity a problem past in a small Bajhang village,BAJHANG: Kantari Sarki of Sandil village in Thalara Rural Municipality-6 Bajhang is not worried about collecting water these days. Today there is a tap right in front of her house through which water flows 24 hours. The only concern she has is to make sure none of the village kids leave the tap on. She checks from time to time because the households are billed through a metre for the water they consume. All 38 households in the village have their own water taps. Once identified as an unclean village Sandil has turned things around with the now availability of sufficient water and has transformed into a clean and hygienic village. Clean houses tidy children and gardens full of freshly grown vegetables have made the village very appealing to an outsider’s eye. Just until about one and a half years ago people of Sandil would not have even dreamt that they would one day have a tap of their own which would dispense water all day long. They had a huge water scarcity problem and had to wake in the middle of the night to fill water from a well located at half-hour’s distance from their village. Whoever reached there first would get the water others were compelled to use unclean water from the river. It has however become the first village in the district to have water taps in each household. The taps were installed in each household of the village one and a half years ago with the investment of Rs 3.5 million from Thalara Rural Municipality and Rural Water Resource Management Programme. Likewise village locals donated free labour to carry out the task. The water was channeled from Chipleti. Chairperson of Chipleti Private Tap Drinking Water and Cleanliness Consumers Committee Saimal Chauhan stated that a metre has been attached to each of the taps and the households have been paying a monthly fee determined by the quantity of water used. He added that having their own taps has made the villagers accountable for their maintenance despite there being a designated person for the same. With the financial and technical support of the Rural Water Resource Management Programme the rural municipality has completed the construction of private water taps in 224 houses in five villages — Taranti Serala Sandil Gadi and Mallo Dikla. Chief of the District Coordination Committee Khadga Bahadur Khadka opined that the initiative taken by Thalara Rural Municipality to bring water into each household and to effectively manage the drinking water programme was exemplary.

Contractors occupying Khullamanch in Martadi,BAJURA NOVEMBER 10 The Khullamanch in Martadi Bajura has been left in the lurch for the last two years after contractors used the space to stock construction materials. The Khullamanch has yet to come into operation since then as the local government has paid no attention for its operation. The contractors have been controlling Khullamanch after they started keeping construction materials there. Locals complained that the District Coordination Committee had paid no attention to the fact that contractors had occupied the public place for the last two years. Milan Jung Karki a local said the chief district officer mayor and other people’s representatives of Badimalika Municipality were mute spectators. Civil Society leader Tularam Jaisi said action should be taken against the contractors as they had no right to misuse a public place by keeping it for themselves. He said the CDO had to take initiative if somebody was using the public places as if it were private property. Meanwhile the contractors claimed that they had not kept the construction materials of District Administration and Badimalika Municipality. Even CDO Krishna Gaire was unaware about it. Gaire said that the construction materials would be removed from the Khullamanch after coordinating with the municipality within one to two days. The area was used for public programmes such as celebrating national days and organising speeches among others.

Russia says its Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine is 92% effective,MOSCOW: Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine is 92% effective at protecting people from COVID-19 according to interim trial results the country’s sovereign wealth fund said on Wednesday as Moscow rushes to keep pace with Western drugmakers in the race for a shot. The initial results are only the second to be published from a late-stage human trial in the global effort to produce vaccines that could halt a pandemic that has killed more than 1.2 million people and ravaged the world economy. The results are based on data from the first 16000 trial participants to receive both shots of the two-dose vaccine the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) which has been backing its development and marketing it globally said. “We are showing based on the data that we have a very effective vaccine” said RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev adding that it was the sort of news that the vaccine’s developers would talk about one day with their grandchildren. The analysis was conducted after 20 participants in the trial developed COVID-19 and examined how many had received the vaccine versus a placebo. That is significantly lower than the 94 infections in the trial of a vaccine being developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech. To confirm the efficacy rate Pfizer said it would continue its trial until there were 164 COVID-19 cases. RDIF said the Russian trial would continue for six more months and data from the study will also be published in a leading international medical journal following a peer review. European stocks and U.S. stock futures extended their gains slightly after Russia’s announcement. ANOTHER BOOST Russia’s announcement follows swiftly on from results posted on Monday by Pfizer and BioNTech which said their shot was also more than 90% effective. The Russian results are another boost to other COVID-19 vaccines currently in development and are a proof of concept that the disease can be halted with vaccination. Experts said knowledge about the trial’s design and protocol was sparse making it difficult to interpret the figures released on Wednesday. Scientists have raised concerns about the speed at which Moscow has worked giving regulatory go ahead for the shot and launching a mass vaccination programme before full trials to test its safety and efficacy had been completed. Russia registered its COVID-19 vaccine for public use in August the first country to do so though the approval came before the start of the large-scale trial in September. The so-called Phase III trial of the shot developed by the Gamaleya Institute is taking place in 29 clinics across Moscow and will involve 40000 volunteers in total with a quarter receiving a placebo shot. The chances of contracting COVID-19 were 92% lower among people vaccinated with Sputnik V than those who received the placebo the RDIF said. That’s well above the 50% effectiveness threshold for COVID-19 vaccines set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “I can see no a priori reason to disbelieve these results but it’s so very hard to comment because there is so little data there” said Danny Altmann a professor of Immunology at Imperial College London. He said that while the Russian release was similar in its level of detail to the one from Pfizer and BioNTech the key difference was that Pfizer’s release came against a backdrop of a wealth of published data on how the trial was designed its protocol and what its endpoints were. The results of the early-stage trials were peer reviewed and published in September in The Lancet medical journal. SPUTNIK V The Russian drug is named Sputnik V after the Soviet-era satellite that triggered the space race a nod to the project’s geopolitical importance for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The vaccine is designed to trigger a response from two shots administered 21 days apart each based on different viral vectors that normally cause the common cold: human adenoviruses Ad5 and Ad26. The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology and is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens such as actual virus particles. Russia is also testing a different vaccine produced by the Vector Institute in Siberia and is on the cusp of registering a third Putin said on Tuesday adding that all of the country’s vaccines were effective. RDIF said as of Nov. 11 no serious side effects had been reported during the Sputnik V Phase III trial. Some volunteers had short-term minor adverse events such as pain at the injection site flu-like syndrome including fever weakness fatigue and headache it said. MASS VACCINATIONS Successful vaccines are seen as a crucial to restoring daily life around the world by helping end the health crisis that shuttered businesses and put millions out of work. Russia registered the vaccine for domestic use in August and has also inoculated 10000 people considered at high risk of COVID-19 outside of the trial Putin has said that Russia expects to start mass vaccinations by the end of the year. “The publication of the interim results of the post-registration clinical trials that convincingly demonstrate Sputnik V vaccine’s efficacy gives way to mass vaccination in Russia against COVID-19 in the coming weeks” Alexander Gintsburg director of the Gamaleya Institute said. Moscow is rolling out a large network of vaccination rooms and residents who want the shot may be able to get it as early as next month if large volumes of doses are supplied by then Deputy Mayor Anastasia Rakova said on Oct. 30. However production challenges remain. Earlier estimates that Russia could produce 30 million doses of the vaccine this year have since been scaled down. Moscow aims to produce 800000 doses this month industry minister Denis Manturov has said followed by 1.5 million in December. But significantly higher volumes of output per month are expected from early 2021. Manturov cited issues with scaling up production from small to large-volume bioreactors while Putin last month cited issues with the availability of equipment. In late October the vaccination of new volunteers was temporarily paused due to high demand and a shortage of doses. Officials have said that domestic production of the vaccine will be used first to meet Russia’s needs. RDIF however has also struck several international supply deals amounting to 270 million doses in total. It is expected that these will in large part be produced in other countries and RDIF has previously announced a deal to manufacture 300 million doses in India and an undisclosed amount of doses in Brazil China and South Korea. Trials have also begun in Belarus and are on track to begin soon in the United Arab Emirates Venezuela and India. Russia reported 19851 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours and a record high of 432 deaths. At 1836960 its overall case tally is the fifth largest in the world behind the United States India Brazil and France.  
UN urges Mozambique to investigate reported massacres beheadings,JOHANNESBURG: The United Nations called on Mozambique to investigate reports that militants had massacred villagers and beheaded women and children in a restive northern region. As many as 50 people have died in recent days in attacks by fighters linked to Islamic State local media including Mediafax and The Pinnacle News have reported. Violence had surged this year in Cabo Delgado – a province that borders Tanzania and is the site of a multi-billion dollar natural gas project – alarming governments across southern Africa. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for an investigation in a statement late on Tuesday. “The Secretary-General is shocked over recent reports of massacres by non-State armed groups in several villages … including the reported beheading and kidnapping of women and children” his spokesman said. There was no immediate response from the government. Militants seeking to carve out an Islamist state started attacks in Cabo Delgado in 2017. They have seized key towns for brief periods and hit military targets this year. In September Amnesty International accused Mozambican soldiers of committing atrocities during a crackdown on the violence but the defence ministry dismissed the reports saying militants regularly impersonated soldiers.

Sudan braces for up to 200000 fleeing Ethiopia fighting,NAIROBI: Up to 200000 refugees could pour into Sudan while fleeing the deadly conflict in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region officials say while the first details are emerging of largely cut-off civilians under growing strain. Long lines have appeared outside bread shops in the Tigray region and supply-laden trucks are stranded at its borders the United Nations humanitarian chief in the country told The Associated Press in an interview. “We want to have humanitarian access as soon as possible” Sajjad Mohammad Sajid said. “Fuel and food are needed urgently.” Up to 2 million people in Tigray have a “very very difficult time” he said late Tuesday including hundreds of thousands of displaced people. Communications remain almost completely severed with the Tigray region a week after Ethiopia’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive in response to an alleged attack by regional forces. He insists there will be no negotiations with a regional government he considers illegal until its ruling “clique” is arrested and its well-stocked arsenal is destroyed. The standoff leaves nearly 900 aid workers in the Tigray region from the U.N. and other groups struggling to contact the outside world with pleas for help. “Nine U.N. agencies almost 20 NGOs all depending on two offices” with the means to communicate Sajid said. In addition more than 1000 people of different nationalities are stuck in the region he said. That includes tourists. Countries urgently are seeking their evacuation. With airports in Tigray closed roads blocked internet service cut off and even banks no longer operating it “makes our life very difficult in terms of ensuring almost 2 million people receive humanitarian assistance” Sajid said. There is no sign of a lull in the fighting that has included multiple airstrikes by federal forces and hundreds of people reported dead on each side. Ethiopia’s federal government and Tigray’s regional government blame each other for starting the conflict. Each regards the other as illegal. It remains difficult for diplomats experts and others to very either side’s claims. Under growing pressure at least 6000 Ethiopian refugees have crossed the now-closed border into Sudan the state-run SUNA news agency there reported late Tuesday. The agency citing unidentified officials said that over 200000 Ethiopians were expected to cross into Sudan in the coming days.

Modi’s coalition won a fourth straight term in Bihar the third-most populous state and one of the poorest in India the country which has recorded more than 8.5 million COVID-19 cases the world’s second-highest tally after the United States. The alliance led by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 125 seats in the 243-member Bihar assembly Election Commission data showed after counting started on Tuesday. The counting process took much longer than usual because more electronic voting machines were deployed to avoid crowding in polling centres as per health rules. “This result not only reflects the faith of the poor labourers farmers and youth in the successful fight of the Modi government against corona but is also a lesson for those who mislead the country” the BJP’s second-most powerful leader interior minister Amit Shah said on Twitter. Modi who had announced a slew of projects for Bihar days before its three-phase voting started last month said the win showed the state’s only “aspiration” was economic development. About 1.5 million lowly paid workers from Bihar were forced to head back home from cities such a New Delhi and Mumbai many on foot carrying luggage and children on their shoulders after the factories or other places they worked in shuttered following Modi’s sudden announcement of a national lockdown in late March. Their images and videos had made national and international headlines. Many are now starting to regain work as the economy has been almost fully reopened. Bihar’s unemployment rate has averaged 22.6% since April compared with 13% for the country as a whole data from private think-tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy shows. The state sends the fourth highest number of lawmakers to the lower and upper houses of parliament and whoever rules it generally goes on to do well in electing those leaders too. After Bihar the BJP is expected to do well in state elections in Assam and West Bengal next year though it has yet to form a strong base in the southern state of Tamil Nadu that also votes in 2021.  
China’s ByteDance challenges Trump’s TikTok divestiture order,NEW YORK/WASHINGTON: ByteDance the Chinese parent company of video-sharing app TikTok filed a petition late on Tuesday with a US Appeals Court challenging a Trump administration order set to take effect on Thursday requiring it to divest TikTok. President Donald Trump in an Aug. 14 order directed ByteDance to divest the app within 90 days which falls on Thursday. The Trump administration contends TikTok poses national security concerns as the personal data of U.S. users could be obtained by China’s government. TikTok which has over 100 million U.S. users denies the allegations. In the petition filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ByteDance said it is seeking a court review of the divestment order claiming that the order and a finding by a U.S. agency that TikTok represented a security threat were unlawful and violated rights under the U.S. Constitution. ByteDance which has been in talks for a deal with Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to shift TikTok’s U.S. assets into a new entity also said it is requesting a 30-day extension on the Aug. 14 divestment order so that it can finalize terms of the deal. “Facing continual new requests and no clarity on whether our proposed solutions would be accepted we requested the 30-day extension that is expressly permitted in the August 14 order” TikTok said in a statement. “Without an extension in hand we have no choice but to file a petition in court to defend our rights” the company said. The White House and Treasury declined to comment. The Justice Department did not immediately comment. In September TikTok announced it had a preliminary deal for Walmart and Oracle to take stakes in a new company to oversee U.S. operations. Trump has said the deal had his “blessing.” One big issue that has persisted is over the ownership structure of the new company TikTok Global that would own TikTok’s U.S. assets. In its court filing ByteDance said it submitted a fourth proposal on Friday that contemplated addressing U.S. concerns “by creating a new entity wholly owned by Oracle Walmart and existing U.S. investors in ByteDance that would be responsible for handling TikTok’s U.S. user data and content moderation.” ByteDance said in its court filing it plans to file a request “to stay enforcement of the Divestment order only if discussions reach an impasse and the government indicates an intent to take action to enforce the order.” The petition names Trump Attorney General William Barr Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) the inter-agency panel that reviews certain transactions involving foreign investment on national security concerns. It says the CFIUS action and Trump order “seek to compel the wholesale divestment of TikTok a multi-billion-dollar business built on technology developed by” ByteDance “based on the government’s purported national security review of a three-year-old transaction that involved a different business.” A person briefed on the matter told Reuters CFIUS stopped responding to ByteDance soon after Trump’s last public TikTok comments on Sept. 19. TikTok said Tuesday it has “received no substantive feedback on our extensive data privacy and security framework.” The order was based on a government review of ByteDance’s 2017 acquisition of U.S. social media app Musical.ly which ByteDance merged into TikTok. ByteDance’s lawsuit also referenced Trump’s comments at a September campaign rally that the parties to the deal would “pay $5 billion into a fund for education” so that “we can educate people as to the real history of our country.” ByteDance and Tiktok said in the court filing they have not agreed “to contribute to such a fund.” Separate restrictions on TikTok from the U.S. Commerce Department have been blocked by federal courts including restrictions on transactions that were scheduled to take effect Thursday that TikTok warned could effectively ban the app’s use in the United States. A Commerce Department ban on Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google offering TikTok for download for new U.S. users that had been set to take effect on Sept. 27 has also been blocked.  
Europe COVID death toll tops 300000 as winter looms and infections surge,More than 300000 people have died of COVID-19 across Europe according to a Reuters tally on Tuesday and authorities fear that fatalities and infections will continue to rise as the region heads into winter despite hopes for a new vaccine. With just 10% of the world’s population Europe accounts for almost a quarter of the 1.2 million deaths globally and even its well-equipped hospitals are feeling the strain. After achieving a measure of control over the pandemic with broad lockdowns earlier this year case numbers have surged since the summer and governments have ordered a second series of restrictions to limit social contacts. In all Europe has reported some 12.8 million cases and about 300114 deaths. Over the past week it has seen 280000 cases a day up 10% from the week earlier representing just over half of all new infections reported globally. Hopes have been raised by Pfizer Inc’s announcement of a potentially effective new vaccine but it is not expected to be generally available before 2021 and health systems will have to cope with the winter months unaided. Britain which has imposed a fresh lockdown in England has the highest death toll in Europe at around 49000 and health experts have warned that with a current average of more than 20000 cases daily the country will exceed its “worst case” scenario of 80000 deaths. France Spain Italy and Russia have also reported hundreds of deaths a day and together the five countries account for almost three quarters of the total fatalities. Already facing the prospect of a wave of job losses and business failures governments across the region have been forced to order control measures including local curfews closing non-essential shops and restricting movement. France the worst-affected country in the EU has registered more than 48700 infections per day over the past week and the Paris region’s health authority said last week that 92% of its ICU capacity was occupied. Facing similar pressures Belgian and Dutch hospitals have been forced to send some severely ill patients to Germany. In Italy which became a global symbol of the crisis when army trucks were used to transport the dead during the early months of the pandemic daily average new cases are at a peak at more than 32500. Deaths have been rising by more than 320 per day over the past three weeks. While the new vaccine being developed by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech will take time to arrive authorities are hoping that once winter is passed it will stem further outbreaks next year. Citi Private Bank analysts described the news as “the first major advance toward a Post-COVID world economy”. “More than any fiscal spending package or central bank lending programme a healthcare solution to COVID has the greatest potential to restore economic activity to its full potential…” it said in a note. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Monday said the European Union would soon sign a contract for 300 million doses of the vaccine just hours after the drugmaker announced promising late-stage trials. Yet health experts cautioned that the vaccine should it be approved was no silver bullet – not least because the genetic material it’s made from needs to be stored at temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below. Such requirements pose a challenge for countries in Asia as well as Africa and Latin America where intense heat is often compounded by poor infrastructure.  
India to recruit fewer Nepalis in army?,KATHMANDU NOVEMBER 10 In a departure from the Indian government’s policy of recruiting soldiers in Gurkha Rifles regiments from among Nepal-domiciled and India-domiciled Gurkhas in a 60:40 ratio the Indian government has okayed the Indian Army’s proposal to recruit people from the Kumaon and Garhwal regions of Uttrakhand in GR regiments. On Saturday Indian Express reported that the Indian authorities had approved recruitment of non-Gurkha personnel in three of the seven GR regiments. Ashok Mehta who retired as major general from Indian Army told THT that the Indian government okayed the Indian Army’s proposal to recruit people from Kumaon and Garhwal in Gurkha Rifles two months ago as it had been facing a shortfall in its Gurkha regiments for the past two years. He added that although it was a pilot project it was a departure from the Indian government’s policy as it could have recruited Gurkhas from Nepal to make up for the shortfall. He however hastened to add “The Indian government’s move to recruit from Kumaon and Garhwal is an old policy and it has nothing to do with the current tension between India and Nepal over Nepal’s new map.” Nepal had issued a new political and administrative map depicting Kalapani Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura as its own territories. India has political and administrative control over these areas and claims them to be its own. Mehta said the Indian government used to recruit Nepalis in Assam Rifles as well but stopped doing that 20 years ago. He said the new move was aimed at reducing dependence on Nepali Gurkhas because political leaders in Nepal often call for stopping recruitment of Nepalis in Gurkha regiments and voices were being raised in India also that only Indians should be recruited in Gurkha regiments. He said the Indian government might have taken the new initiative to prepare for the scenario in which the Nepali government might decide to prohibit Nepalis from joining the Indian Army. Mehta said till the mid- 70s India recruited all soldiers in Gurkha Rifles from Nepal but in the mid- 1970s the ratio of Nepal-domiciled Gurkhas and India-domiciled Gurkhas was 70:30. This ratio changed to 60:40 in the 1980s. Spokesperson for Nepal’s Ministry of Defence Krishna Prasad Gyawali and Spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sewa Lamsal told THT separately that the Nepal government had no plan to prohibit Nepali Gurkhas from joining the Indian Army. Recruitment of Nepalis in the Indian Army dates back to the British Raj. A tripartite agreement signed by Nepal India and the United Kingdom in 1947 allowed the Indian Army and the British Army to recruit soldiers from Nepal.

Emerging role of TVET,The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the labour market hard everywhere. Unemployment has increased and Nepal is no exception. The world of work is rapidly transforming through digitisation and technological innovations demanding continuous skilling and reskilling. The traditional education system chalk and duster learning approach might not prepare today’s youth for the continually evolving world of work. Lack of technical knowledge vocational training and employability skills or simply lack of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) is one of the reasons for unemployment. Private sector partnerships apprenticeships and on the job training (OJT) are crucial to match the labour market needs. TVET addresses issues of skills mismatch through the acquisition of employability skills and provision of high quality relevant training to individuals. TVET offers a wide range of training courses that help acquire skills for any industry. TVET has produced entrepreneurs in the field of health agriculture engineering tourism and hospitality and much more creating job opportunities to farmers technicians electricians mechanics construction workers chefs and healthcare workers to name a few. Currently the job market has witnessed a mismatch between demand and supply. The best solution to unemployment is through industry-institute linkage to ensure that young people acquire the appropriate skills and relevant training from TVET institutes. Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) launched a TVET public information campaign in February 2020 to create awareness about the benefits of TVET and the employment opportunities available to students teachers and their families. The campaign was a massive success. However due to COV- ID-19 implementation has been affected. The campaign moved online to sustain the momentum it has gained. The campaign has been spreading to the broader public especially returnee migrant workers via the CTEVT Facebook Page. The campaign is encouraging and empowering the people reaching around 4828239 social media users. TEVT should give continuity to such awareness campaigns enhance visibility and branding and mobilise the programmes efficiently to inform the public and support behaviour and perception change towards technical education. The government and concerned stakeholders must also take serious steps toward policy reform. They must explore ways for easy access and enrollment free vocational training job placement of graduates for productive employment.

Ambassadors’ appointment: Quality versus party affiliation,The appointment of ambassadors seems to be clearly on the basis of the political parties’ strength in the parliament sidelining professional expertise in the selection. Loyalty of the ambassador-designate towards one particular political party without diplomatic maneuvering skills will hardly bring the results desired by the government The functioning of an ambassador in the host country constitutes an integral component of managing the foreign affairs of any nation. Working as per the broad policy guidelines of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs led by the country’s foreign minister the ambassador represents the nominating government abroad that has a great bearing on enhancing the bilateral relations by way of accelerating mutual cooperation. Such an assignment abroad demands relevant academic qualifications professional training communication skills including command of language executive experience required expertise and diplomatic skills on the part of assigned ambassadors. But the current trend of Nepal seems to be moving in reverse direction. At a time when Nepal is traversing through a path of many hardships since the last few years including the COVID-19 pandemic this year the issue of appointing Nepali envoys abroad may not seem relevant in the present context. But the selection and appointment of envoys have many more consequences and implications – both immediate and long-term – as the country’s image promotion and projection in the external world and garnering support of the friendly countries for Nepal’s development largely depend on how a diplomat displays his skills. Obviously good performance from the ambassadorial position to the extent desired by his country demands high level skills in representation negotiation and public relations by establishing links with people from various walks of life involving academics media business community civic societies professional associations celebrities and intellectuals of the host country. On top of all these thorough knowledge about the main core and instincts of the country’s foreign and defense policy development priorities and need for external assistance are the pre-requisites demanded of an envoy. However the appointment of ambassadorial positions seems to be clearly on the basis of the political parties’ strength in the parliament sidelining professional expertise in the selection. Loyalty of the ambassador-designate towards one particular political party without diplomatic maneuvering skills will hardly bring the results desired by the government. During the erstwhile Panchayat regime and before the restoration of multiparty system envoys were appointed at the discretion of the king on merit basis – loyalty coupled with high caliber professional expertise and past profile. The candidates were selected from among the senior joint secretaries secretaries of the regular Foreign Service cadres or career diplomats and from those who had served the country in various top positions — in the bureaucracy army and Tribhuvan University among others. The other consideration in appointing ambassadors included persons considered suitable for securing the host country’s support on some specific issues of national importance. The current process of selecting the candidates apparently appears to be more rigorous but the quality of the nominees displays a degrading trend. Starting first at the party stage then to the cabinet through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs then to the Parliamentary Special Hearing Committee though its efficacy remains debatable then only to the final appointment after getting the green signal called the Agreemo from the host government. Yet hardly any ambassador in the present context is reportedly hailed as successful thanks to the quota system at the cost of efficiency. Nepal has had many appreciable examples of ambassadorial excellence in the past worth citing. Major General Padam Bahadur Khatry in the late 1960s had played an instrumental role in getting Nepal elected to the Non-Permanent Seat of the UN Security Council. Dr Bhesh Bahadur Thapa who served as envoy to the US twice succeeded in garnering the support of the US for the Peace Zone Proposal of Nepal considered to be a national gain for Nepal at that particular period. Late King Birendra’s state visit to the US was also arranged due to his diplomatic skills and also in arranging appointments for Nepali premiers with two US presidents. Interestingly only three Nepali prime ministers namely B P Koirala Dr Tulsi Giri and Sher Bahadur Deuba have had appointments with US presidents. Likewise Dr Trailokya Nath Upreti was credited for his immense role as ambassador to France and UNESCO. Similarly as Nepal’s ambassador to India Bedananda Jha was able to have separate treaties of Trade and Transit between Nepal and India in the interest of the former. During late Jaya Pratap Rana’s tenure as the permanent representative to the UN Nepal was able to become a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the second time. Kedar Bhakta Mathema as Nepal’s envoy to Japan succeeded in having the then Japanese premier pay an official visit to Nepal. Professor Surendra Bahadur Shrestha successfully represented Nepal during the Gulf War. While tracing the few past achievements made by the country’s ambassadors abroad the Nepali intelligentsia and media would like to again see their ambassadors impart a new dimension. In the absence of competent ambassadors among others Nepal lost an opportunity to be a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 2006 and chairman of the UN General Assembly. It also failed to maneuver even a short visit of the US president during his visit to South Asia. Also there have not been visits of heads of state or government to Nepal from influential countries since quite a long time due to diplomatic failures including those of ambassadors.

EDITORIAL: Farmers’ woe,This has happened largely because the government has failed to crack down on the industrialists for duping the farmers It’s a farmer’s woe whose end is nowhere in sight. It’s been years since many sugar mills have not cleared their dues to the farmers for the sugarcane purchased. Despite the efforts by the government to have the dues cleared the industrialists have not obliged. Sugarcane is a cash crop that is harvested only once a year and depriving the farmers of their payment puts them in a lot of distress. For one they cannot meet their daily household expenses and worse still many cannot repay the loans taken to purchase among other things fertilisers machinery and other inputs. Domestic sugar mills have been unwilling to clear the dues to the farmers citing heavy losses suffered in running their factories due to huge cheap imports of the commodity from India and Pakistan some three years ago. A flimsy excuse that has discouraged many a farmer from growing sugarcane as is evident from its output in Sarlahi in southeast Nepal. The district used to produce about 3.5 million quintals of sugarcane in the past but its production is likely to be just about half that yield this year. So how can Nepal achieve self-sufficiency in sugar? Different sugar industries owe the farmers a whopping Rs 1.2 billion with Sri Ram Sugar Mills alone owing Rs 350 million including to its staff. One industry – Annapurna Sugar and General Industries – has been holding up payment of about Rs 330 million to thousands of farmers for the past five years. This has happened largely because the government has failed to crack down on the industrialists while paying only lip service to the meek farmers to resolve the issue. It is for reasons like these and faulty government policies that Nepal has not been able to become self-sufficient in sugar. Nepal’s biggest and most modern sugar mill at Birgunj built with assistance of the then Soviet Union for instance closed down soon after the advent of multi-party democracy because of political intervention and party politics. It was producing about 17000 tons of sugar in the Nineties. The government must decide whether it wants to produce all of the country’s demand for sugar in the country itself or keep importing billions of rupees worth of the commodity year after year. It cannot be talking about creating jobs in the country while allowing cheap imports and smuggling through the porous border to continue. If it is serious about industrialising Nepal then it must in all seriousness provide all the support to the entrepreneurs. On the other hand industrialists must stick to ethical business practices such as making timely payments to the farmers and not creating artificial shortages for small gains. Industries are also known to be taking the locals for granted discharging harmful effluent in the surroundings without a thought to the environment. Hence the locals of Kalaiya Bara have padlocked Reliance Sugar and Chemical Industries whose harmful discharge despite an agreement reached some eight years ago have been affecting the lives of the people. Should the industry fail to operate within a month it will be another reason for the dwindling sugar production in the country this year making Nepal heavily reliant on imports for its needs. Revival of tourism The COVID-19 pandemic has not deterred trekking and mountaineering enthusiasts on the major tourist routes. After seven months of complete lockdown the hoteliers and restaurant owners have now resumed their business in Manang district by adopting health measures. The government had also allowed the transport operators and hoteliers to resume their business by adhering to the health protocol. Manang and Mustang are the Himali districts that attract more than 2 lakh tourists in normal time. Trekking agencies and hotel operators resumed their business from October 14. The 14-day trekking route on the Annapurna Circuit has now blossomed with domestic and foreign tourists who were waiting for the government’s permission to reach there. Life in Manang and Mustang largely depends on the hospitality business. However the travel agencies visitors and hotel owners must not compromise on the health protocol prescribed by the government. A single negligence from either side can dash everybody’s hope of reviving the battered tourism business. There is still a long way to go to bring the country’s tourism industry back to normalcy that has gone down by almost 90 per cent due to the pandemic.

FDI pledges promising but huge gap still in actual inflow,KATHMANDU NOVEMBER 11 Despite the adverse effects of coronavirus pandemic across the world the foreign direct investment (FDI) commitments to Nepal have not decreased. According to the latest statistics of the Department of Industry (DoI) Nepal received FDI commitments worth Rs 19.03 billion for 89 projects in around four months (from mid-July to November 10) of the current fiscal year. Nepal had received FDI pledges worth Rs 18.94 billion for 112 projects during the same period of last fiscal year. Similar to past several years China topped the list in terms of FDI commitment to Nepal. Of the 89 projects China alone pledged to pour Rs 15.78 billion in 83 projects. British Virgin Islands India the United Kingdom and Mexico were other countries to make FDI commitments to Nepal during the period. Sector-wise the country’s tourism sector received highest FDI commitments followed by the services sector. The FDI commitments in the tourism sector doubled from Rs 6.97 billion for 47 projects in last fiscal to Rs 13.8 billion for 58 projects this fiscal during the review period. Meanwhile the FDI commitments in the services sector decreased from Rs 5.9 billion for 35 projects in the first four months of last fiscal to Rs 4.4 billion for 25 projects in the review period of this fiscal. Similarly FDI commitments have also come down in manufacturing and information and technology-based sectors while the FDI pledges in the agro and forestry-based sector has increased this fiscal in comparison to last fiscal. According to Binod Khadka information officer of the DoI receiving FDI commitment worth Rs 19 billion in about four months is a positive sign when compared to the total FDI commitments in the previous fiscal year which was around Rs 38 billion. He further informed that FDI commitments had increased by 49.1 per cent in the fiscal year 2019-20 in comparison to the fiscal year 2018-19 when such pledges stood at around Rs 25 billion. However according to the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) there is a huge gap between approved FDI and actual FDI inflows in Nepal. In the previous fiscal year although Nepal received FDI commitments worth Rs 38 billion the actual FDI inflows stood at only 51.7 per cent or Rs 19.48 billion. Similarly the total approved FDI was Rs 24.99 billion in the fiscal year 2018-19 while the realised amount was just 52.3 per cent or Rs 13.07 billion. As per NRB Spokesperson Gunkar Bhatta the gap between FDI commitments and actual inflows could be minimised if Nepal strengthens its services and facilitation for foreign investors and speeds up necessary legal reforms. He further said that FDI inflows in Nepal can also be increased by strengthening the One-Stop Service Centre making the capital market debenture-oriented attracting foreign investors in small development projects at the federal level with the option of public-private partnership among others.

Sugarcane farmers demand clearance of dues,KATHMANDU NOVEMBER 10 While sugarcane farmers are seeking government support to recoup their dues from sugar mills the mismatch in the outstanding amount as per the government’s and farmers’ calculations could complicate the matter. As per Rakesh Mishra patron of the Sugarcane Farmers Struggle Committee at least 6000 sugarcane farmers have not received Rs 360 million — Rs 300 million from Annapurna Sugar and General Industries for the past five years and Rs 60 million from Mahalaxmi Sugar Mill for the last two years — in Sarlahi district alone. He further informed that the total outstanding amount that farmers across the country need to receive is a whopping Rs 1.2 billion. On the other hand Urmila KC undersecretary and assistant spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry Commerce and Supplies said that a majority of sugar mills have already released payments to the farmers. “Farmers have not received payments from four sugar mills — Annapurna Sugar and General Industries (Rs 330 million) of Sarlahi Lumbini Sugar Mill (Rs 84.1 million) of Nawalparasi Indira Sugar and Agro Industries (Rs 47 million) of Nawalparasi and Sri Ram Sugar Mills (Rs 350 million including payments of staff) of Rautahat” she said. Among them Sri Ram Sugar Mills has made a commitment to clear the dues by selling the land on which the factory is based as per KC. “We have requested the Ministry of Home Affairs to issue instructions to the concerned District Administration Offices to facilitate in collecting the payment worth Rs 790 million from the four sugar mills as soon as possible” she informed adding “Similarly initiatives are being taken to hold meetings with the owners of those mills that have still not made the payments.” Meanwhile Kapil Muni Mainali president of Nepal Sugar Producers Federation also estimates that there is around Rs 800 million in total remaining to be paid to cane farmers by the sugar mills. Despite the mismatch in the outstanding amount as per the government’s estimation and farmers’ calculation one thing is clear that sugarcane farmers have been deprived of getting millions of their outstanding amount from the sugar mills for the past many years. Mishra shared that since the sugarcane farmers have been facing problems in receiving their due payments most of them have started growing other crops. “Sarlahi alone used to yield 3.5 to five million quintals of sugarcane in previous years but it is likely to decrease to two million quintals this year” he mentioned. He further shared that the government’s vision of prosperous Nepal is meaningless as it has not been able to solve the problems of farmers because agriculture is the foundation of a prosperous Nepal. Meanwhile Sashi Kant Agrawal president of Nepal Sugar Mills Association stated that some of the sugar mills have not been paying the sugarcane farmers for the past many years and farmers should receive their payments. He said domestic sugar mills have not been able to pay farmers as they have been facing heavy losses due to huge import of cheap sugar from India and Pakistan around three years back. “However payments must be made to farmers regardless of the loss. The government has to call the industrialists and make them commit to pay the farmers by giving them a certain time limit and last warning.” He added “The government had asked the industrialists to make payments earlier too but neither the government could take strict action against the industrialists nor have the industrialists implemented the agreement.” Following the government’s failure to fulfil its commitment to clear the dues of sugarcane farmers within January 21 as per the agreement signed on January 3 a team of sugarcane farmers from Sugarcane Farmers Struggle Committee had visited the Minister of Industry Commerce and Supplies Lekhraj Bhatt on Sunday. The team handed over a memorandum to the minister asking him to implement the pact signed on January 3 and demanded that their outstanding payments be cleared within Chhath failing which they will start a protest from December 12.

Huawei to sell phone unit for $15 bln to Shenzhen gov’t Digital China others: sources,HONG KONG: Huawei plans to sell budget-brand smartphone unit Honor in a 100 billion yuan ($15.2 billion) deal to a consortium led by handset distributor Digital China and the government of its home town of Shenzhen people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The plan comes as U.S. restrictions on supplying Huawei Technologies Co Ltd force the world’s second-biggest smartphone maker – after South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd – to focus on high-end handsets and corporate-oriented business the people said. It also indicates little expectation for any swift change in the U.S. perception of Huawei as a security risk following a new U.S. administration one of the people said. The all-cash sale will include almost all assets including brand research & development capabilities and supply chain management the people said. Huawei could announce it as early as Sunday one of the people said. Main Honor distributor Digital China Group Co Ltd will become a top-two shareholder of sold-off entity Honor Terminal Co Ltd with a near-15% stake said two of the people. Honor Terminal was incorporated in April and is fully owned by Huawei the corporate registry showed. Digital China which also partners Huawei in businesses such as cloud computing plans to finance the bulk of the deal with bank loans the two people said. It will be joined by at least three investment firms backed by the government of financial and technology hub Shenzhen with each owning 10% to 15% they said. After the sale Honor plans to retain most of its management team and 7000-plus workforce and go public within three years the people said declining to be identified due to confidentiality constraints. Honor declined to comment. Huawei and the Shenzhen government did not respond to requests for comment. Digital China – which did not respond to request for comment on Tuesday – in a stock exchange filing on Wednesday said it had not reached any agreement with Huawei about the Honor brand to date. “It seems to be a drastic move given the Honor brand has been highly complementary to Huawei’s smartphone portfolio” said Nicole Peng mobility vice president at researcher Canalys. “The interesting synergy with potential buyers actually can be Honor’s IoT (Internet of Things) business.” Honor is one of several brands seeking growth by turning phones into controllers of internet-connected devices such as home appliances. SANCTIONS Shares of Digital China hit the maximum upper trading limit of 10% at 31.68 yuan ($4.80) on Tuesday after Reuters reported Huawei’s Honor sale plan. “Digital China is a major distributor for Honor in China so we think this will help Honor maintain its market share in China” said Tom Kang research director at Counterpoint. “But its overseas operations may struggle as the U.S. policy on a spin-off is not clear and Huawei’s huge marketing support may not be present.” The U.S. government last year restricted U.S. companies from conducting business with Huawei – also the world’s biggest telecoms equipment vendor – citing national security concerns. Huawei has repeatedly denied being a risk. In May Washington announced rules constricting Huawei’s ability to procure chips featuring U.S. technology for use in fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications network equipment and smartphones such as its premium P and Mate series. Huawei established Honor in 2013 but the business mostly operates independently. Divestment could mean Honor is no longer subject to Huawei’s U.S. sanctions analysts said.

Domestic production to meet flower demand,KATHMANDU NOVEMBER 8 In previous years the country used to import thousands of flower garlands to meet the demand for the same during Tihar. However domestic production is expected to fulfil the requirement this year. The rise in domestic production and also a possible decline in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to contribute to the country not having to import flowers in Tihar this year. According to Kumar Kasaju Shrestha president of the Floriculture Association Nepal domestic production will suffice to meet the market demand for flowers and garlands this Tihar because many people are still scared of travelling and demand will be tepid due to the pandemic. “So we will not have to import flowers this Tihar like in the previous years” he added. He informed that in the upcoming Tihar there will be demand for about 1.5 million units of garlands — 1.2 million units of marigold garlands (Sayapatri) and 300000 units of globe amaranth (Makhamali) garlands. Last year floriculture entrepreneurs had sold around 2.5 million units of garlands of which about 300000 units were imported from India. As per Shrestha consumers will be able to purchase marigold garlands at Rs 60 to Rs 70 per unit and globe amaranth garlands at Rs 30 to Rs 50 a unit while farmers will get Rs 40 to Rs 45 for each unit of marigold garland and Rs 20 to Rs 25 for each unit of globe amaranth garland. At present marigold flowers are being cultivated commercially in around 157 hectares of land in 32 districts across the country. Districts such as Chitwan Makawanpur and Sindhuli have the highest production of marigold flowers whereas Kathmandu Bhaktapur and Lalitpur also produce the flower in significant numbers. Commercial marigold farming has also been started in districts like Dhading Nuwakot Kailali Rupandehi Jajarkot Doti Dipayal and Surkhet. “Many people have started commercial farming of marigold in Nepal these days due to its whopping demand in urban markets and the satisfactory returns” Shrestha mentioned. Meanwhile globe amaranth flowers are mainly grown in rural parts of Bhaktapur Kathmandu and Lalitpur districts. “People have started cultivating this flower in the eastern parts of the country too including Palpa” he informed. There are over 700 entrepreneurs actively engaged in the floriculture industry of the country at the moment and there are around 43000 farmers directly involved in growing flowers. Although Nepal had been dependent on imports for marigold flowers it has been self-reliant in globe amaranth flowers. In fact the country has been exporting globe amaranth garlands abroad where Nepalis reside and celebrate Bhai Tika. As per Shrestha the country had exported 200000 units of globe amaranth garlands to various countries last year. “However demand has not been confirmed yet this year” he added. Meanwhile the Godavari Flower Exhibition which is organised in between Dashain and Tihar every year will not be held this year due to the coronavirus pandemic as per Shrestha.

‘Evacuate stranded Nepalis through regular flights’,KATHMANDU NOVEMBER 8 The COVID-19 Crisis Management Centre (CCMC) has recommended the government to stop evacuation flights and repatriate Nepalis who are still stranded in various destinations through regular flights. According to Member Secretary of CCMC Mahendra Guragain the diplomatic missions located in different countries have informed that there are not many Nepalis now who are stranded abroad. “As regular flights have also resumed operations the remaining stranded Nepalis can be brought back by accommodating them in regular flights. So the CCMC meeting held today has decided that the evacuation flights are not necessary any more” Guragain said. “More stranded Nepalis will be brought back to the country for a few more days till there is flight permission for evacuation flights” he added. So far a total of 136216 Nepali citizens stranded in different countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been brought back to Nepal through 911 evacuation flights as per Guragain. “Among them there were also a few regular passengers and foreigners” he informed.

Samsung may launch flagship phone early to grab Huawei share: sources,SEOUL: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd may launch its flagship Galaxy S smartphones more than a month earlier than expected in a bid to grab market share from Huawei and fend off competition from Apple Inc three sources familiar with the matter said. Huawei Technologies Co Ltd once challenged Samsung’s top position in the global smartphone market but the Chinese rival is in survival mode with U.S. restrictions choking off its supplies of chips used in smartphones and telecom equipment. South Korean chip industry officials hope Joe Biden’s presidency will ease some of those restrictions although they are far from certain as they also expect the incoming U.S. administration to maintain a tough stance on China. Samsung is preparing to launch its new Galaxy S21 as early as late January next year whereas it previously launched its flagship S20 phone in early March this year the sources said asking not to be identified because the plan is not public. Samsung Electronics declined to comment. The South Korean company shipped 59% fewer Galaxy S20 5G series handsets in the United States in the second quarter compared to the previous model’s performance a year earlier according to research firm Canalys. In contrast Apple shipped 15% more of its flagship iPhone 11 than last year’s best-seller the iPhone XR. Samsung which lost its No.1 position to Huawei in the second quarter regained the crown in the third thanks in part to the U.S. restrictions on Huawei. A person at one major supplier of smartphone chips said Huawei’s stockpiles were expected to run out some time early next year. Samsung however faces intensifying competition from Chinese rivals like Xiaomi and Oppo which are expected to take advantage of Huawei’s struggle to retain market share. Apple also launched its iPhone series in October about a month later than usual stepping up competition.  
75pc factories in Hetauda Industrial Estate to be booked,HETAUDA NOVEMBER 8 Over 75 per cent of the factories within the Hetauda Industrial Estate have been found to be operating without obtaining a permit for the weighing machines from the department under Bureau of Standards and Metrology. There are around 111 factories in the Hetauda Industrial Estate but only 25 of them have obtained permission for measurement standard to distribute industrial products according to the Standards and Metrology Regional Office in Birgunj. There are various factories producing noodles biscuits flour dairy products mineral water soap washing powder and paints among others being run within the estate. Chief of the Standards and Metrology Regional Office in Birgunj Sashibhusan Yadav said all the factories should test their weighing scale and obtain a permit to conduct transactions. Those not abiding by this rule are subject to action as per the Standard Measurement and Weight Act-2025 (1968). The scale machine — be it analogue or digital — needs to be examined to protect consumers’ rights and welfare. Such weighing scales need to be certified every two years. A four-member team led by Assistant Inspector of the regional office Birendra Upadhyay checked the status of the renewal of the scale machines of 60 enterprises and firms.   A version of this article appears in print on November 09 2020 of The Himalayan Times.  
Babar named Pakistan test captain takes charge of all three formats,Pakistan named Babar Azam as their new test captain on Tuesday putting the batsman in charge of teams across all formats. Babar replaces Azhar Ali who led Pakistan to a 1-0 series defeat in England earlier this year. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) made the announcement after Babar led the team to Twenty20 and one-day international series victories over Zimbabwe on home soil. “As we are looking into the future it is appropriate that we appoint him the captain now so that he continues to grow stronger with every match” PCB chairman Ehsan Mani said in a statement https://www.pcb.com.pk/press-release-detail/babar-azam-appointed-test-captain.html. “I wish Babar all the best and remain optimistic that he will help Pakistan cricket make an upward movement across all formats not only through his performance but also with his positive attitude and result-oriented approach.” Babar has been a prolific scorer for Pakistan and currently ranks among the top five batsmen in all three formats. The 26-year-old’s first assignment as test skipper will be the ICC World Test Championship matches against New Zealand which will be played in Mount Maunganui and Christchurch from Dec. 26-30 and Jan. 3-7 respectively. “I feel truly honoured to have been appointed Test captain and join some of the most iconic players who have captained Pakistan in the purist format of the game” said Babar who took charge of Pakistan‘s limited-overs teams earlier this year. “I am ready and prepared to take up the additional responsibility and the fact which gives me additional confidence is that I can do the job is the experience that is available to me in the changing room in the shape of the players and support staff.”  
Bangladesh skipper Mominul tests positive for coronavirus,DHAKA: Bangladesh test captain Mominul Haque has tested positive for the novel coronavirus the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s chief physician said on Tuesday. “He is coronavirus positive with mild symptoms” physician Debashish Chowdhury told reporters. The 29-year-old batsman who has represented the Asian side in 40 tests is self-isolating at home. Mominul is the second high-profile Bangladesh cricketer to test positive for the virus after national Twenty20 captain and all-rounder Mahmudullah who was forced to miss his team’s playoff in the Pakistan Super League. Experts fear Bangladesh might face another surge in infections during the winter having reported 423620 cases so far including 6108 deaths.  
Rapinoe criticises Man Utd over delayed investment in women’s team,World Cup-winning US midfielder Megan Rapinoe has denounced the lack of investment in women’s soccer around the world saying it is “disgraceful” that a club like Manchester United had taken so long to revive their team. United faced criticism for not forming a team after their women’s side was scrapped in 2005 and were granted a licence to play in the second tier Championship in 2018. The team immediately earned promotion to the Women’s Super League (WSL) and finished fourth in their maiden campaign in the top flight. They lead the table after six games this season following Sunday’s 1-0 win over Arsenal. “Women’s football in England is the same as in America. It’s so far behind because of what we’ve had to overcome in the lack of investment” Rapinoe told the BBC. “It’s 2020. How long has the Premier League been around? And we’re only just seeing a club like Manchester United put effort and pounds towards a women’s team? Frankly it’s disgraceful.” Several U.S. women’s international players have joined the WSL this season with Tobin Heath and Christen Press signing for United Rose Lavelle and Sam Mewis moving to Manchester City and Alex Morgan sealing a loan switch to Tottenham Hotspur. Rapinoe who claimed the Ballon d’Or in 2019 after a career-defining year in which she won her second World Cup title opted out of National Women’s Soccer League competitions this year. “I’ve had a few teammates go abroad and play while I’m training and trying to keep fit in the hopes that eventually we’ll be out of this hellscape” Rapinoe said. “I want to keep playing. I’m definitely not anywhere near retirement – I absolutely want to play at the Olympics.”  
Bayern waiting to see extent of Kimmich injury,DORTMUND: Bayern Munich were waiting to discover the extent of Joshua Kimmich’s injury on Saturday after he limped out of their 3-2 win at Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga. The 25-year-old one of the most consistent performers for the European champions hurt his right knee as he tripped Erling Haaland to stop the Dortmund striker breaking away in the 35th minute. Germany international Kimmich who was booked for the foul was clearly in a lot of pain and had to be helped from the field by two members of staff. Bayern said he would be examined when they returned to Munich. “We’ll have to wait and see. He’s one of our key players in that position. A lay-off wouldn’t be easy to deal with” said coach Hansi Flick. Kimmich is also in Germany’s squad for the Nations League games at home to Ukraine on Nov. 14 and away to Spain three days later.  
Former James Bond actor Sean Connery dies aged 90,Scottish movie legend Sean Connery who shot to international stardom as the suave sexy and sophisticated British agent James Bond and went on to grace the silver screen for four decades has died aged 90. The BBC and Sky News reported his death on Saturday. FILE – Actor Sean Connery arrives for the Edinburgh International Film Festival opening night showing of the animated movie ‘The Illusionist’ at the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh Scotland on June 16 2010. Photo: Reuters “I was heartbroken to learn this morning of the passing of Sir Sean Connery. Our nation today mourns one of her best loved sons” said Scottish First Minster Nicola Sturgeon. “Sean was a global legend but first and foremost he was a patriotic and proud Scot.” Connery was raised in near poverty in the slums of Edinburgh and worked as a coffin polisher milkman and lifeguard before his bodybuilding hobby helped launch an acting career that made him one of the world’s biggest stars. Connery will be remembered first as British agent 007 the character created by novelist Ian Fleming and immortalized by Connery in films starting with ““Dr. No” in 1962. As Bond his debonair manner and wry humour in foiling flamboyant villains and cavorting with beautiful women belied a darker violent edge and he crafted a depth of character that set the standard for those who followed him in the role. He would introduce himself in the movies with the signature line “Bond – James Bond.” But Connery was unhappy being defined by the role and once said he “hated that damned James Bond”. Tall and handsome with a throaty voice to match a sometimes crusty personality Connery played a series of noteworthy roles besides Bond and won an Academy Award for his portrayal of a tough Chicago cop in “”The Untouchables” (1987). He was 59 when People magazine declared him the “sexiest man alive” in 1989. Connery was an ardent supporter of Scotland’s independence and had the words “Scotland Forever” tattooed on his arm while serving in the Royal Navy. When he was knighted at the age of 69 by Britain’s Queen Elizabeth in 2000 at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh he wore full Scottish dress including the green-and-black plaid kilt of his mother’s MacLeod clan. BECAME FED UP WITH ‘IDIOTS’ Some noteworthy non-Bond films included director Alfred Hitchcock’s “Marnie” (1964) “The Wind and the Lion” (1975) with Candice Bergen director John Huston’s “The Man Who Would be King” (1975) with Michael Caine director Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” (1989) and the Cold War tale “The Hunt for Red October” (1990). Fans of alternative cinema will always remember him starring as the “Brutal Exterminator” Zed in John Boorman’s mind-bending fantasy epic “Zardoz” (1974) where a heavily moustachioed Connery spent much of the movie running around in a skimpy red loin-cloth thigh-high leather boots and a pony tail. Connery retired from movies after disputes with the director of his final outing the forgettable “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen” in 2003. “I get fed up dealing with idiots” he said. The Bond franchise was still going strong more than five decades after Connery started it. The lavishly produced movies packed with high-tech gadgetry and spectacular effects broke box office records and grossed hundreds of millions of dollars. After the smashing success of “Dr. No” more Bond movies followed for Connery in quick succession: “From Russia with Love” (1963) “”Goldfinger” (1964) “”Thunderball” (1965) and ““You Only Live Twice” (1967). Connery then grew concerned about being typecast and decided to break away. Australian actor George Lazenby succeeded him as Bond in “”On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” in 1969. But without Connery it lacked what the public wanted and he was lured back in 1971 for ““Diamonds Are Forever” with temptations that included a slice of the profits which he said would go to a Scottish educational trust. He insisted it would be his last time as Bond. Twelve years later at age 53 Connery was back as 007 in ““Never Say Never Again” (1983) an independent production that enraged his old mentor producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli. PREFERRED BEER TO MARTINIS In a 1983 interview Connery summed up the ideal Bond film as having “marvellous locations interesting ambiance good stories interesting characters – like a detective story with espionage and exotic settings and nice birds.” Connery was a very different type from Fleming’s Bond character with his impeccable social background preferring beer to Bond’s vodka martini cocktails that were “”shaken not stirred”. But Connery‘s influence helped shape the character in the books as well as the films. He never attempted to disguise his Scottish accent leading Fleming to give Bond Scottish heritage in the books that were released after Connery‘s debut. Born Thomas Connery on Aug. 25 1930 he was the elder of two sons of a long-distance truck driver and a mother who worked as a cleaner. He dropped out of school at age 13 and worked in a variety of menial jobs. At 16 two years after World War Two ended Connery was drafted into the Royal Navy and served three years. ““I grew up with no notion of a career much less acting” he once said. ““I certainly never have plotted it out. It was all happenstance really.” Connery played small parts with theatre repertory companies before graduating to films and television. It was his part in a 1959 Disney leprechaun movie “Darby O’Gill and the Little People” that helped land the role of Bond. Broccoli a producer of the Bond films asked his wife to watch Connery in the Disney movie while he was searching for the right leading actor. Dana Broccoli said her husband told her he was not sure Connery had sex appeal. “I saw that face and the way he moved and talked and I said: ‘Cubby he’s fabulous!'” she said. “He was just perfect he had star material right there.” Connery married actress Diane Cilento in 1962. Before divorcing 11 years later they had a son Jason who became an actor. He married French artist Micheline Roquebrune whom he met playing golf in 1975.  
Arrest made in 2008 kidnapping of journalists in Afghanistan,NEW YORK: An Afghan man has been brought to the United States to face charges in the 2008 gunpoint kidnapping of a journalist for The New York Times an Afghan journalist and a driver in Afghanistan federal authorities announced Wednesday. The charges against Haji Najibullah 42 were in a six-count indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court. He briefly appeared at a hearing conducted electronically because of the coronavirus where a U.S. magistrate judge ordered him detained after his court-appointed lawyer Mark Gombiner declined to seek bail. Gombiner did not respond to a message seeking comment. A prosecutor said Najibullah was brought from Ukraine to the United States on Tuesday to face charges including hostage taking conspiracy and kidnapping. Authorities did not say where or when he was first arrested but in a release they thanked Ukrainian authorities for help in his arrest and transfer. If convicted he could face life in prison. The kidnapping victims were not identified by authorities but the description matched the kidnapping of the journalist David Rohde who worked for the Times and an Afghan journalist Tahir Ludin as they were heading to interview a Taliban leader. Both made a dramatic escape from a Taliban-controlled compound in Pakistan’s tribal areas more than seven months after their Nov. 10 2008 kidnapping. Their driver Asadullah Mangal was the third kidnapping victim and escaped a few weeks after Ludin and Rohde. According to an indictment Najibullah was among several kidnappers armed with machine guns who took the men hostage before forcing them five days later to hike across the border from Afghanistan to Pakistan. Najibullah and other kidnappers forced the victims to make numerous calls and videos seeking help during their captivity as they demanded money from Rohde’s family and the release of Taliban prisoners by the U.S. the indictment said. It said Najibullah and others forced the victims to create at least three videos in which they begged for help while surrounded by masked machine gun-toting guards. It said Najibullah recorded a video in which Rohde was forced to beg for his life while a guard pointed the barrel of a machine gun at his face. Also charged in the indictment was Timor Shah who was described as the head guard of the hostages and Akhund Zada who the indictment said was among six armed guards who forced the hostages to hike from Afghanistan to Pakistan. Neither were in custody. The indictment had been sealed since 2014 when it was obtained by then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. Also in 2014 the Times reported that Najibullah led a group described as a radical spinoff of the Taliban with a history of targeting journalists. In 2009 Ludin told The Associated Press in interviews that he was hired by the Times to arrange the interview with a Taliban leader and to translate. At the time he worked as a journalist mostly for the Times of London. Ludin said he was beaten and repeatedly threatened by captors whose demands kept changing. Rohde told Ludin he had not been beaten and Ludin said he had not seen any evidence Rohde was harmed. The men escaped their captors by climbing over the wall of a compound where they were held in the North Waziristan region of Pakistan. “Journalists risk their lives bringing us news from conflict zones and no matter how much time may pass our resolve to find and hold accountable those who target and harm them and other Americans will never wane” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said.  
Bill Cosby now 83 grins in newly released prison mug shot,HARRISBURG: A newly released prison mug shot shows Bill Cosby smiling with a disposable mask hanging off his face. The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections recently updated Cosby’s mug shot something routinely done to document changes to inmates’ appearance as they age. Cosby’s new photo was taken Sept. 4. Later in the evening a blurry picture was tweeted from Cosby’s verified account showing him using what appeared to be a prison telephone pulling a mask away from his chin as he smiled. It was accompanied by text that said: “This photo was taken by his publicist Andrew Wyatt during his first virtual video conference call with Mr. Cosby last week. We are posting this to reassure his family and supporters that he is doing ok during this pandemic.” Cosby 83 was convicted of felony sex assault and is serving a three- to 10-year prison term. An appeals court had upheld his conviction but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed this year to review two key issues in the case. The appeal is scheduled to be heard Dec. 1. Cosby a once-beloved comedian long known as “America’s Dad” became the first celebrity convicted of sexual misconduct in the #MeToo era when he was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman at his home near Philadelphia in 2004.  
India cinemas reopen to small audiences after months in dark,NEW DELHI: Seven months after screens went dark cinemas reopened Thursday in much of India with mostly old titles on the marquee — a sign of the country’s efforts to return to normal as the pace of coronavirus infections slows but also of the roadblocks that remain. The return to movie theaters comes as India is registering the highest number of daily cases globally and is expected to soon top the list worldwide in terms of total number of reported infections passing the United States. But trends also suggest the spread is beginning to slow. Nearly 10000 theaters closed in mid-March when the government imposed restrictions to fight the virus which has torn through India and is blamed for more than 110000 deaths. Cinemas are among the last public places to reopen — a hugely symbolic move in a country known the world over for the lavish productions pumped out by its Bollywood film industry. On Thursday however movie theatres struggled to lure the public back. Many ran shows for small audiences. In the capital of New Delhi one cinema attracted a little more than two dozen people for its late afternoon show. Most of the moviegoers included guards and the housekeeping staff of the shopping mall that houses the theater. Every year the $2.8 billion industry produces more than 2000 films that feature complex dance routines singing and spectacularly large casts serving to unite a diverse nation of 1.4 billion people. The industry’s success over the years has embedded moviegoing into India’s contemporary culture and been a boon for the economy which since the pandemic began has nosedived to its slowest growth on record. But even if theaters are reopening filmmaking hasn’t rebounded. Reeling from zero box-office returns in this pandemic year Indian filmmakers have so far not lined up any new big-ticket releases and have pushed any films they have made directly to online streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Such struggles can be seen the world over as the pandemic has devastated the entertainment industry. Earlier this month a major American movie theater chain said it would temporarily shutter hundreds of locations in the U.S. and the U.K. Movie theaters pose some of the biggest infection risks since they put people in a closed space where the virus can spread easily for an extended period of time. To minimize the danger Indian cinemas have separated seats staggered show times and are encouraging digital payments. Masks and temperature checks are mandatory. “We have put everything into place maybe more than what has been prescribed” said Gagan Kapur regional head of the PVR Cinemas in New Delhi. Still some Indian states have been cautious. Authorities in Mumbai the home of Bollywood put off reopening cinemas for the time being. The southern state of Maharashtra of which Mumbai is the capital is the worst-hit in India with more nearly 37% of the country’s COVID-19 fatalities. With few new films coming out of Bollywood theaters on Thursday mostly re-released earlier hits though one new film “Khaali Peeli” a typical Bollywood potboiler came out. Older films like “Tanhaji” a historical epic about a Hindu warrior who rises against the Mughals “Thappad” a social drama on domestic violence and “Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan” a rom-com featuring a gay couple were played across multiple screens. “PM Narendra Modi” an unabashed hagiography of the Indian prime minister that was released last year also ran in some places. The reopening of cinemas comes as trends suggest a decline in new infections. India saw a surge in July and added more than 2 million in August and another 3 million in September. But it is seeing a slower pace of coronavirus spread since mid-September when the daily infections touched a record of 97894. It is recording an average of just over 70000 cases daily so far this month. But some experts say that India’s tally of more than 7.3 million total infections may not be reliable because of poor reporting and inadequate health infrastructure. India is also relying heavily on antigen tests which are faster but less accurate than traditional RT-PCR tests. Health officials have also warned about the potential for the virus to spread during the religious festival season beginning later this month. “The next two and a half months are going to be very crucial for us in our fight against corona because of the winter season and the festival season” Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said Wednesday. “It becomes responsibility of every citizen to not let our guard down and follow COVID-19 appropriate behavior to curb spread of the infection.”  
Apple unveils first Macs built to run more like iPhones,SAN RAMON: Apple is rolling out new Mac computers powered by the same kind of chips that run iPhones and iPads a move aimed at making it easier for its most popular products to work together. For instance Macs using the new chips will be able to run the same apps designed for the iPhone’s mobile operating system although it appears some developers aren’t immediately keen on making those apps available for Macs. Apple didn’t demonstrate any other interoperability features based on the new chips although analysts expect more cross-pollination. The new Mac lineup unveiled Tuesday will be in stores five months after Apple announced it would abandon its longtime partner Intel in favor of using its own processors for Mac computers. Apple said its new Mac chips make possible faster processing speeds sleeker designs and longer running times on a single battery charge. For instance some Macs have eliminated a cooling fan inside the machines helping slim down their design. The transition to the new in-house chips could also create stumbling blocks for Apple and other software makers aiming to adapt existing Mac software so it will also run smoothly on the new models. Initially Apple will only be putting its chips in smaller computers — the 13-inch MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro as well as the Mac Mini desktop. The company expects it will take another two years before all its Macs are running on the in-house chips. All three new computers are supposed to be available in stores next week with prices starting at almost $700 for the Mac Mini to $1200 for the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The new Macs are debuting amid high demand for laptop computers as consumers companies schools and government agencies adjust to a work-at-home shift triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Even if a vaccine eases the threat posed by the novel coronavirus people still are expected to be working more frequently from home than they previously did.. Apple’s Mac sales surged 17% during the first nine months of this year compared to 2019. The company’s iPhone revenue fell 9% over the same span as people continued to hold on to their older models for longer periods or bought devices powered by Google’s Android software instead. Apple still get four times more revenue from iPhones than it does from Macs Sales of Macs also lag far behind those of PCs made by Lenovo HP and Dell that run Microsoft’s Windows software and primarily use chips made by Intel and AMD.  
Matrika Prasad Koirala’s ‘Koshiko Katha’ relaunched,KATHMANDU: Publication Nepalaya republished Matrika Prasad Koirala’s ‘Koshiko Katha’ an anthology of essays as part of its Classics for 2020 on Tuesday. Issuing a press statement today Nepalaya said the book was published initially in 1990 by Prativa Puraskar Pratisthan Biratnagar but had been out of print for many years now. Speaking about the book Kamal Koirala son of the late author said “The book had been out of print for a while now. I am very happy that after all these decades the book will find its way into readers’ homes because the book has much to offer in terms of personal history of Koiralas in exile.” He further said the book will also help the readers to comprehend the anthropological account of Koshi river its inhabitants and their stories. “The nine essays in the collection meander along the banks of Koshi sometimes reaching all the way to India where the author spent a major part of his childhood on a political exile imposed upon his family” reads the statement. Koirala does not limit his study of Koshi River to politics but gently exfoliates its historic anthropological and mythical aspects as well. “The book is a crisp but dense historic document.” Matrika Prasad Koirala is remembered mostly for his role in the anti-Rana movement of the 1940s as Nepali Congress Supreme Commander. He eventually became the first non-Rana Nepali prime minister in 1950. The book with its intentionally personal essays on Koshi throws valuable insight into Koirala’s political persona and also into Nepal’s history reads the statement. ‘Koshiko Katha’ is priced at Rs 295 in Nepali market and is also available at all leading bookstores across the country. The digital copy of the book can also be purchased from www.thuprai.com while it will also be available worldwide on Amazon.com according to Nepalaya.  
One in five COVID-19 patients develop mental illness within 90 days – study,LONDON: Many COVID-19 survivors are likely to be at greater risk of developing mental illness psychiatrists said on Monday after a large study found 20% of those infected with the coronavirus are diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder within 90 days. Anxiety depression and insomnia were most common among recovered COVID-19 patients in the study who developed mental health problems and the researchers also found significantly higher risks of dementia a brain impairment condition. “People have been worried that COVID-19 survivors will be at greater risk of mental health problems and our findings … show this to be likely” said Paul Harrison a professor of psychiatry at Britain’s Oxford University. Doctors and scientists around the world urgently need to investigate the causes and identify new treatments for mental illness after COVID-19 Harrison said. “(Health) services need to be ready to provide care especially since our results are likely to be underestimates (of the number of psychiatric patients)” he added. The study published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal analysed electronic health records of 69 million people in the United States including more than 62000 cases of COVID-19. In the three months following testing positive for COVID-19 1 in 5 survivors were recorded as having a first time diagnosis of anxiety depression or insomnia. This was about twice as likely as for other groups of patients in the same period the researchers said. The study also found that people with a pre-existing mental illness were 65% more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 than those without. Mental health specialists not directly involved with the study said its findings add to growing evidence that COVID-19 can affect the brain and mind increasing the risk of a range of psychiatric illnesses. “This is likely due to a combination of the psychological stressors associated with this particular pandemic and the physical effects of the illness” said Michael Bloomfield a consultant psychiatrist at University College London. Simon Wessely regius professor of psychiatry at King’s College London said the finding that those with mental health disorders are also at higher risk of getting COVID-19 echoed similar findings in previous infectious disease outbreaks. “COVID-19 affects the central nervous system and so might directly increase subsequent disorders. But this research confirms that is not the whole story and that this risk is increased by previous ill health” he said.  
Pfizer vaccine trial success signals breakthrough in pandemic battle,Pfizer Inc’s PFE.N experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results the drugmaker said on Monday a major victory in the war against a virus that has killed over a million people and battered the world’s economy. Scientists public health officials and investors welcomed the first successful interim data from a large-scale clinical test as a watershed moment that could help turn the tide of the pandemic if the full trial results pan out. However mass roll-outs which needs regulatory approval will not happen this year and several vaccines are seen as necessary to meet massive global needs. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE 22UAy.F said they had found no serious safety concerns yet and expected to seek U.S. emergency use authorization this month raising the chance of a regulatory decision as soon as December. If granted the companies estimate they can roll out up to 50 million doses this year enough to protect 25 million people and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. “Today is a great day for science and humanity” said Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla noting the data milestone comes with “infection rates setting new records hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen.” Experts said they wanted to see the full trial data but the preliminary results looked encouraging. “This news made me smile from ear to ear. It is a relief to see such positive results on this vaccine and bodes well for COVID-19 vaccines in general” said Peter Horby professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University of Oxford. There are still many questions such as how effective the vaccine is by ethnicity or age and how long immunity may last. “But the bottom line is as a vaccine it’s more than 90% effective which is extraordinary” top U.S. infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN. Pfizer expects to seek U.S. emergency use authorization for people aged 16 to 85. To do so it will need two months of follow-up safety data to assure no side effects crop up. That is expected to be available in the third week of November. US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said it would take several weeks for U.S. regulators to receive and process the data before a potential approval. The prospect of a vaccine electrified world markets with the S&P 500 and Dow hitting record highs. JPMorgan said on Monday it expected the S&P 500 index to hit 4000 points by early 2021 and called Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine and called Pfizer Inc’s PFE.N COVID-19 vaccine update “one of the best backdrops for sustained gains in years. Stock of theme park and film company Walt Disney rose 12% and movie chain operator AMC Entertainment Holdings was up 51%. Shares in companies that have thrived during lockdowns such as Netflix Inc NFLX.O and conferencing platform Zoom Video ZM.O tumbled. Gun stocks sold off on higher hopes for a return to normal and a lack of civil unrest. Pfizer shares jumped more than 8% to their highest since July last year while BioNTech’s stock hit a record high. Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan forecast the vaccine may generate sales in excess of $8.5 billion for Pfizer in 2020-2021 alone. Shares of other vaccine developers in the final stage of testing also rose with Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N up nearly 4% and Moderna Inc MRNA.O whose vaccine uses a similar technology as the Pfizer shot up more than 8%. Britain’s AstraZeneca AZN.L however fell 2%. Moderna is expected to report results from its large-scale trial later this month. “It’s likely that we’re going to have more than one vaccine that’s effective” Fauci said. William Schaffner infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville Tennessee called the Pfizer results better than most anticipated. “The study isn’t completed yet but nonetheless the data look very solid.” U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed the test results and the market boost: “STOCK MARKET UP BIG VACCINE COMING SOON. REPORT 90% EFFECTIVE. SUCH GREAT NEWS!” he tweeted. President-elect Joe Biden said the news was excellent but did not change the fact that face masks social distancing and other health measures would be needed well into next year. The World Health Organization called the results very positive but warned there was a funding gap of $4.5 billion that could slow access to tests medicines and vaccines in low- and middle-income countries. There are other challenges as well that could affect less affluent countries. The Pfizer vaccine must be shipped and stored at an extremely cold temperature which requires necessary infrastructure. Even many U.S. hospitals lack these super cold storage units which may impact when and where the vaccine becomes available in many U.S. rural areas as well. That highlights the need for more traditional vaccines in development such as J&J’s candidate. ‘NEAR ECSTATIC’ Still there was cause for jubilation. “I’m near ecstatic” Bill Gruber one of Pfizer’s top vaccine scientists said in an interview. “This is a great day for public health and for the potential to get us all out of the circumstances we’re now in.” Between 55% and 65% of the population will need to be vaccinated to break the dynamic of the spread of COVID-19 said Germany’s health minister Jens Spahn adding that he did not expect a shot to be available before the first quarter of 2021. The European Union said on Monday it would soon sign a contract for up to 300 million doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The companies have a $1.95 billion contract with the U.S. government to deliver 100 million vaccine doses beginning this year. They did not receive research funding from the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed vaccine program. The drugmakers have also reached supply agreements with the United Kingdom Canada and Japan. The interim analysis conducted after 94 participants in the trial developed COVID-19 examined how many had received the vaccine versus a placebo. Pfizer did not provide that detail but over 90% effective implies that no more than 8 of the 94 had received the vaccine administered in two shots about three weeks apart. The efficacy rate which could drop once full results are available is well above the 50% effectiveness required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a coronavirus vaccine. Shortly after Pfizer’s announcement Russia said its Sputnik V vaccine was also more than 90% effective based on data collated from inoculations of the public. To confirm the efficacy rate Pfizer said it would continue its trial until there were 164 COVID-19 cases among volunteers. Bourla told CNBC on Monday that could be before the end of November. Lawrence Young a professor of molecular oncology at Britain’s University of Warwick noted that the data may show the vaccine keeps people from getting sick but not necessarily from becoming infected. “And the subtlety there … is if you’re infected then you can still transmit the virus.” Dozens of drugmakers and research groups around the globe have been racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19 which on Sunday exceeded 50 million cases since the new coronavirus first emerged late last year in China. The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines. The technology is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens such as actual virus particles. The Trump administration has said it will have enough vaccine doses for all of the 330 million U.S. residents who want it by the middle of 2021.      
India’s Tata launches faster COVID-19 test as cases rise,NEW DELHI: India‘s Tata Group launched a COVID-19 test kit on Monday that it says will process results more easily and faster than the RT-PCR method considered the gold standard for detection at a time when cases are still rising in the country. The nasal swab test developed jointly by Tata and the government is also more accurate than the rapid antigen test currently favoured in India the ministry of science and technology said. Tata Medical and Diagnostics the healthcare arm of the cars-to-clothes conglomerate will begin manufacturing 1 million kits a month at its plant in the southern city of Chennai and can then scale up rapidly CEO Girish Krishnamurthy told Reuters in an interview. TataMD CHECK as the product is called can return results in 90 minutes and will be sold through hospitals and laboratories from next month with the initial focus being on the home market Krishnamurthy said. “You don’t need big expensive equipment to do the test so it becomes more accessible and available and more labs can start testing” he said. A process based on artificial intelligence and automation will be used to test swabs Krishnamurthy said. India‘s COVID-19 cases have risen by 45903 to 8.55 million in the past 24 hours government data showed with the country’s infections lagging only the United States’. Deaths increased by 490 to 126611. India does more than 1 million COVID-19 tests a day nearly 60% of them using the rapid antigen method that is faster but less accurate. It wants to increase testing to more than 1.5 million a day though health experts have warned its heavy reliance on the rapid antigen tests that typically detect the virus around 80% to 90% of the time could under-report infections. Antigen devices return results in about 15 minutes compared with several hours for the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. “Our aspiration is that this can become a new standard in testing” Krishnamurthy said.
